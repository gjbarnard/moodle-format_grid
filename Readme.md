Grid Course Format
============================
A topics based format that uses a grid of user selectable images to popup a light box of the section.

Required version of Moodle
==========================
This version works with Moodle version 2013051400.00 release 2.5 (Build: 20130514) and above until the next release.

Please ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in 'Installing Moodle' on
'docs.moodle.org/25/en/Installing_Moodle'.

Installation
============
1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
   format relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
2. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' (docs.moodle.org/en/admin/setting/maintenancemode) so that there are no
   users using it bar you as the administrator - if you have not already done so.
3. Copy 'grid' to '/course/format/' if you have not already done so.
4. Go back in as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to
   'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' if this does not happen.
5. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.
6. You may need to check that the permissions within the 'grid' folder are 755 for folders and 644 for files.

Uninstallation
==============
1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
2. It is recommended but not essential to change all of the courses that use the format to another.  If this is
   not done Moodle will pick the last format in your list of formats to use but display in 'Edit settings' of the
   course the first format in the list.  You can then set the desired format.
3. In '/course/format/' remove the folder 'grid'.
4. In the database, remove the row with the 'plugin' of 'format_grid' and 'name' of 'version' in the 'config_plugins' table
   and drop the 'format_grid_icon' and 'format_grid_summary' tables.
5. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Upgrade Instructions
====================
1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
   format relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
2. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
3. In '/course/format/' move old 'grid' directory to a backup folder outside of Moodle.
4. Copy new 'grid' to '/course/format/'.
5. Go back in as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to
   'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' if this does not happen.
6. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'
   under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.
7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Downgrading
===========
If for any reason you need to downgrade to a previous version of the format then the procedure will inform you how to
do so:
1.  Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
2.  In '/course/format/' remove the folder 'grid' i.e. ALL it's contents - this is VITAL.
3.  Put in the replacement 'grid' folder into '/course/format/'.
4.  This step depends on if you are downgrading to a version prior to 15th July 2012, this should therefore only be for
    Moodle 2.3.x and below versions.  If you are, perform step 4.1 otherwise, perform step 4.2.
4.1 In the database, remove the row with the 'plugin' of 'format_grid' and 'name' of 'version' in the 'config_plugins' table
    and drop the 'format_grid_icon' and 'format_grid_summary' tables.  If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by
    lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches' under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development ->
    Purge all caches'.
4.2 In the database, change the row with the 'plugin' of 'format_grid' and 'name' of 'version' in the 'config_plugins' table
    to have the same 'value' as '$plugin->version' in the 'grid/version.php' file i.e. like '2013083000'.  Then perform a manual
    'Purge all caches' under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.
5.  Go back in as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to
    'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' if this does not happen.
6.  Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Reporting Issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  The primary
release area is located on https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=format_grid.  It is also essential that you are
operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the format relies on core functionality that
is out of its control.

All 'Grid format' does is integrate with the course page and control it's layout, therefore what may appear to be an issue
with the format is in fact to do with a theme or core component.  Please be confident that it is an issue with 'Grid format'
but if in doubt, ask.

We operate a policy that we will fix all genuine issues for free.  Improvements are at our discretion.  We are happy to make bespoke
customisations / improvements for a negotiated fee.  We will endeavour to respond to all requests for support as quickly as possible,
if you require a faster service then offering payment for the service will expedite the response.

It takes time and effort to maintain the format, therefore donations are appreciated.

When reporting an issue you can post in the course format's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=47'), 
on Moodle tracker 'tracker.moodle.org' ensuring that you chose the 'Non-core contributed modules' and 'Course Format: Grid'
for the component or contact us direct (details at the bottom).

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the format's 
version.php file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.

File information
================

Languages
---------
The grid/lang folder contains the language files for the format, such as:

* grid/lang/en/format_grid.php
* grid/lang/ru/format_grid.php
* grid/lang/es/format_grid.php
* grid/lang/fr/format_grid.php

Note that existing formats store their language strings in the main
moodle.php, which you can also do, but this separate file is recommended
for contributed formats.

Of course you can have other folders as well as English etc. if you want to
provide multiple languages.

Styles
------
The file grid/styles.css contains the CSS styles for the format which can
be overridden by the theme.

Backup
------
The files:

grid/backup/moodle2/backup_format_grid_plugin.class.php
grid/backup/moodle2/restore_format_grid_plugin.class.php

are responsible for backup and restore.

Backup and restore run automatically when backing up the course.
You can't back up the course format data independently.

Roadmap
=============
1. Improved instructions including Moodle docs.
2. User definable grid row icon numbers - https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=196716
3. CONTRIB-3500 - Gridview course format more accessible.
4. CONTRIB-4099 - Grid format does not allow the user to set the size of the image / box.
5. Use of crowd funding facility to support development.
6. Continued maintenance of issues: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB/component/11231.
